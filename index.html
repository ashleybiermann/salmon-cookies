      <p>
        Meet Pat and their family. Pat, a Seattle native, has always loved what the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Of course, the fishing and seafood industry plays a huge role in daily Seattle culture. As the foodie culture continues to grow, baked goods are also finding their way into the hearts and tummies of those who visit. Those two loves are what has inspired Pat to create Salmon Cookies! Salmon cookies are tasty coffee-time confections crafted in the likeness of your beloved northwest swimmers, with just a hint of fishy goodness in every bite!

         Sales are soaring, not only in Seattle, but throughout all five Cookie Counter stores worldwide!

         Can't get enough of Salmon Cookies by consuming the treats themselves? Then check out our Salmon Swag. Bring the Salmon Spirit to your own home with our signature salmon cookie cutter, a slick salmon shirt, or school of salmon stuffies.
